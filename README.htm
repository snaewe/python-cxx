<h1>CXX -- C++ Extensions Support</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
python setup.py install <br>
will install the include files into your Python
include path in a directory "CXX". You refer to the files in your
include statements like this:<br>
#include "CXX/Objects.h"
</p>
<p>
The option --install-header= can be used to change the install directory.
Note that the support files expect the include files to be in a directory
CXX relative to the include path.
</p>
<p>
The support files are installed into your Python installation directory's 
etc/CXX subdirectory. The option --install-source= can be used to change this.
</p>
<p>
A CXX package is created, into which the Demo installs a module "example". 
This package is not necessary for the operation of CXX; it is present to convince Distutils to 
do the installation -- a bug that is already fixed in Distutils' CVS repository.
</p>
<h2>Special considerations with C++</h2>
<p>
You may need to make Python link with C++. To do that, before
running configure, set the environment variables CC to "g++ -fPIC", LINKCC to 'g++' and 
LDSHARED to 'g++ -shared' or whatever is appropriate for your C++ compiler. 
</p>
<h2>Making the Demo</h2>
<p>
The Demo directory contains a small example that also serves as a test for 
CXX. Make and install the Demo with <br>
python setup.py install
</p>
<p>
Run the Demo by importing CXX.example, and running CXX.example.test().
</p>
<h2>Revision History</h2>

<h3>Version 5 (May 18, 2000)</h3>
This version adds Distutils support for installation and some code cleanup.

<h3>Version 4 (October 11, 1999)</h3>

<p>This version contains a massive revision to the part of CXX that supports creating
extension objects and extension modules. Barry Scott contributed these changes.</p>

<p>CXX has always consisted of two parts: the basic CXX_Objects.h and the more
experimental CXX_Extensions.h. We will describe the changes to CXX_Objects first, and then
the changes to CXX_Extensions.h.</p>

<h3>Changes to CXX_Objects</h3>

<h4>1. Owned option eliminates need for FromAPI in most cases</h4>

<p>Object's constructor from PyObject* and method set have a new (backward compatible)
signature:</p>

<p>Object (PyObject* pyob, bool owned = false);<br>
void set(PyObject* pyob, bool owned = false);</p>

<p>Users may call these with owned = true if they own the reference pyob already and want
the Object instance to take over ownership.</p>

<p>A new inline function Object asObject(PyObject* pyob) returns Object(pyob, true); thus,
one way to construct an object from a pointer returned by the Python API is to call
asObject on it. </p>

<p>Previously a class FromAPI was provided to solve the problem of taking over an owned
reference. FromAPI will be eliminated in the next release. It is no longer used by CXX
itself or its demos. The new mechanism is much cleaner and more efficient.</p>

<p>Other classes in CXX have been given the same &quot;owned&quot; option on their
constructors: Int, Float, Long, Complex, SeqBase&lt;T&gt;, Tuple, List, Dict, Module,
Callable.</p>

<h4>2. Namespace support in compiler assumed</h4>

<p>Since EGCS / GCC now supports namespaces and the standard library, the need for
CXX_config.h is almost gone. We have eliminated all the macros except for one obscure one
dealing with iterator traits in the standard library.</p>

<h3>Changes to CXX_Extensions</h3>

<p>The changes to CXX_Extensions.h are not backward compatible. However, they simplify
coding so much that we think it is worth the disruption.</p>

<h4>1. Creating an extension module</h4>

<p>To create an extension module, you inherit from class ExtensionModule templated on
yourself: In the constructor, you make calls to register methods of this class with Python
as extension module methods. In this example, two methods are added (this is a simplified
form of the example in Demo/example.cxx):</p>

<p>class example_module : public ExtensionModule&lt;example_module&gt;<br>
{<br>
public:<br>
example_module()<br>
: ExtensionModule&lt;example_module&gt;( &quot;example&quot; )<br>
{<br>
add_varargs_method(&quot;sum&quot;, &amp;example_module::ex_sum, &quot;sum(arglist) = sum
of arguments&quot;);<br>
add_varargs_method(&quot;test&quot;, &amp;example_module::ex_test, &quot;test(arglist)
runs a test suite&quot;);<br>
<br>
initialize( &quot;documentation for the example module&quot; );<br>
}<br>
<br>
virtual ~example_module() {}<br>
<br>
private:<br>
Object ex_sum (const Tuple &amp;a) { ... }<br>
Object ex_test( const Tuple &amp;a) { ... }<br>
};<br>
</p>

<p>To initialize the extension, you just instantiate one static instance (static so it
doesn't destroy itself!):</p>

<p>void initexample()<br>
{<br>
static example_module* example = new example_module;<br>
}</p>

<p>The methods can be written to take Tuples as arguments and return Objects. If
exceptions occur they are trapped for you and a Python exception is generated. So, for
example, the implementation of ex_sum might be:</p>

<p>Object ex_sum (const Tuple &amp;a)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Float f(0.0);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for( int i = 0; i &lt; a.length(); i++ )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Float g(a[i]);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f = f + g;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return f;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>

<p>class ExtensionModule contains methods to return itself as a Module object, or to
return its dictionary.</p>

<h4>Creating extension objects</h4>

<p>Creating extension objects is of course harder since you must specify how the object
behaves and give it methods. This is shown in some detail in the example range.h and range.cxx,
with the test routine rangetest.cxx, in directory Demo.</p>

<p>Here is a brief overview. You create a class that inherits from PythonExtension
templated upon itself. You override various methods from PythonExtension to implement
behaviors, such as getattr, sequence_item, etc. You can also add methods to the object
that are usable from Python using a similar scheme as for module methods above. </p>

<p>One of the consequences of inheriting from PythonExtension is that you are inheriting
from PyObject itself. So your class is-a PyObject and instances of it can be passed to the
Python C API. Note: this example uses the namespace feature of CXX. The Py:: 's are not
required if you use the namespace instead.</p>

<p>class range: public Py::PythonExtension&lt;range&gt; {<br>
public:<br>
... constructors, etc.<br>
<br>
... methods<br>
// initializer, see below<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static void init_type();<br>
// override functions from PythonExtension<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual Py::Object repr();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual Py::Object getattr( const char *name );<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual int sequence_length();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual Py::Object sequence_item( int i );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual Py::Object sequence_concat( const Py::Object &amp;j );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual Py::Object sequence_slice( int i, int j );<br>
<br>
// define python methods of this object<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Py::Object amethod (const Py::Tuple&amp; args);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Py::Object value (const Py::Tuple&amp; args);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Py::Object assign (const Py::Tuple&amp; args); <br>
};</p>

<p><br>
To initialize the type you provide a static method that you can call from some module's
initializer. This method sets the name, doc string, and indicates which behaviors it
supports. It then adds the methods.</p>

<p>void range::init_type()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaviors().name(&quot;range&quot;);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaviors().doc(&quot;range objects: start, stop, step&quot;);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaviors().supportRepr();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaviors().supportGetattr();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaviors().supportSequenceType();<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add_varargs_method(&quot;amethod&quot;, &amp;range::amethod,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;demonstrate how to document
amethod&quot;);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add_varargs_method(&quot;assign&quot;, &amp;range::assign);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add_varargs_method(&quot;value&quot;, &amp;range::value);<br>
}</p>

<h3>Version 3 (June 18, 1999)</h3>

<p>1. CXX compiles with EGCS snapshot 19990616. EGCS requires a standard library class
random_access_iterator that is not yet available in some other compilers (such as Windows
VC6). Therefore a new switch:</p>

<p>STANDARD_LIBRARY_HAS_ITERATOR_TRAITS</p>

<p>has been added to CXX_Config.h that you may need to toggle if you get an error on the
two lines that mention random_access_iterator. The current definition is correct for VC6
and EGCS-19990616. </p>

<p>2. A new constructor was added to Module to allow construction from a string containing
the module name. A test was added for this to the demo.</p>

<h3>Version 2 (Dec. 28, 1998)</h3>

<p>Fixed definition of extension type to match 1.5.2. This version will presumably not
compile with older versions of Python. This can be fixed by using the previous version's
definition. I did not take the time to find out what these new &quot;flags&quot; are for
nor put in any methods to deal with them.</p>

<h3>Version 1</h3>

<p>This is an experimental set of files for supporting the creation of Python extensions
in C++. </p>

<p>Documentation is in progress at <a href="http://xfiles.llnl.gov">http://xfiles.llnl.gov</a>.
</p>

<p>To use CXX you use the header files in Include, such as CXX_Objects.h or
CXX_Extensions.h. You must include the sources in Src in your sources to supply parts of
the CXX classes required.</p>

<p>A demo is included. The Setup file in this directory compiles this demo named
&quot;example&quot;. To try the demo, which is also a test routine, you import example and
then execute:</p>

<p>example.test()</p>

<p>You can also play with the extension object whose constructor is named &quot;range&quot;:</p>

<p>s = range(1, 100, 2)<br>
print s[2]&nbsp; # should print 5</p>

<p>Compilation with Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 will succeed but only if you have Service
Pack 3 installed. Compilation has been known to succeed on a Unix system using KCC by
using:</p>

<p>setenv CCC &quot;KCC -x&quot;</p>

<p>before running makethis.py.</p>

<p>There is also a python.cxx file for making a stand-alone Python containing this
example, as well as a similar file arraytest.cxx for testing Array.</p>
