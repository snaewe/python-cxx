<h2>Python 3.0 support</h2>
<p>Python 3 will be supported by PyCXX 6.0.0 which I hope to release close to the release of Python 3.0.</p>
<p>Python 2 will continue to be supported with PyCXX 5.</p>
<p>My aim is to add features to PyCXX 5 that will easy the porting of code to Python 3 using PyCXX 6</p>
 
<hr>
<h2>Version 5.4.2 (11-Oct-2008)</h2>
<p>Add support for rich compare.</p>
<p>Add the simplest code for a module with a single function and a single class (Demo/simple.cxx)</p>
<p>Fix long standing bugs with Dict::iterator</p>

<hr>
<h2>Version 5.4.1 (28-Jun-2008)</h2>
<p>Add Boolean type from Vivian De Smedt.</p>
<p>Patch from Dmitry Kostjuchenko to which improves PyCXX method's calling
speed/performance by almost 2 times.</p>
<p>More PY_LONG_LONG support.</p>
<p>No longer allow creation of Py::Int from PY_LONG_LONG as long long cannot fit. Use Py::Long.</p>
<p>Py:Dict can now be constructed from a Py::Object.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Version 5.4.0 (20-Jan-2007)</h2>
<p>PyCXX has a new <a href="https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cxx/trunk/CXX/COPYRIGHT">BSD license</a>
to make it open source compatible.
Many thanks to Sebastian Sauer for bring this matter to our attention and 
to Paul Dubios for working with the LLNL people to get the license changed.</p>
<p>Fix compilation issues with GCC 4.1 found on FC6.</p>
<p>Fix compilation issues caused by problems in IRIX header files.</p>
<p>Add PY_LONG_LONG support from patch contributed by Dmitry Kostjuchenko.</p>


<h2>Version 5.3.6 (21-Oct-2006)</h2>
<p>Add support for Python 2.5</p>
<p>Add support for PY_LONG_LONG to Py::Int()</p>

<h2>Version 5.3.5 (2-Oct-2005)</h2>
<p>More changes to keep GCC 4.0 happy - no warning should be report</p>

<h2>Version 5.3.4 (29-Aug-2005)</h2>
<p>Add interator support - thanks to Helmut Jarausch - see pycxx_iter demo
<p>Allow an extension to be part of a python package
<p>Allow creation of Exception hierachies
<p>Fix problem compiling with GCC 2.9X
<p>Fix uninitialise memory problem
<P>Work around compile problems with the example and GCC 4.0.

<h2>Version 5.3.3 and 5.3.2</h2>
<p>No details recorded</p>

<h2> PyCXX V5.3.1 </h2>
<p>Added fixes to support problems reported against GCC4 builds and .NET 2003 builds
<p>Download PyCXX 5.3.1 from <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cxx/pycxx_5_3_1.tar.gz?download">SourceForge</a>.</p>

<h2> PyCXX V5.3.0 </h2>
<p>I've added Unicode string support to PyCXX and fixed a number of reported bugs.</p>
<p>See the <a href="README.html">README</a> and <a href="PyCXX.html">documentation</a> for details.</p>

<p>Download PyCXX 5.3.0 from <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cxx/pycxx_5_3_0.tar.gz?download">SourceForge</a>.</p>

<h2> PyCXX V5.2.0 </h2>
<p>After a long gap I have updated PyCXX (the name I prefer for CXX) to
fix a number of bugs and add a small number of features.</p>

<p>I'm using the development of <a href="http://pysvn.tigris.org/">pysvn</a> 
to drive the need for fixes and features in PyCXX.</p>

<p>-- Barry Scott, November 2003</p>

<h1>PyCXX is designed to make it easier to extend Python with C++</h1>

<p>
CXX/Objects is a set of C++ facilities to make it easier
to write Python extensions. The chief way in which PyCXX makes it easier
to write Python extensions is that it greatly increases the probability
that your program will not make a reference-counting error and will not
have to continually check error returns from the Python C API. CXX/Objects
integrates Python with C++ in these ways:
<p>
<ul>

<li>
C++ exception handling is relied on to detect errors
and clean up. In a complicated function this is often a tremendous problem
when writing in C. With PyCXX, we let the compiler keep track of what objects
need to be dereferenced when an error occurs.</li>

<li>

The Standard Template Library (STL) and its many algorithms
plug and play with Python containers such as lists and tuples.
</li>

<li>
The optional CXX/Extensions facility allows you to replace the clumsy C tables with objects
and method calls that define your modules and extension objects.
</li>
</ul>
